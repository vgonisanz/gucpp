.SH NAME
curl_easy_getinfo - extract information from a curl handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>

.B "CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *curl, CURLINFO info, ... );"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Request internal information from the curl session with this function.  The
third argument \fBMUST\fP be a pointer to a long, a pointer to a char *, a
pointer to a struct curl_slist * or a pointer to a double (as this
documentation describes further down).  The data pointed-to will be filled in
accordingly and can be relied upon only if the function returns CURLE_OK.  Use
this function AFTER a performed transfer if you want to get transfer related
data.

You should not free the memory returned by this function unless it is
explicitly mentioned below.

.SH TIMES
.nf
An overview of the six time values available from curl_easy_getinfo()

curl_easy_perform()
    |
    |--NAMELOOKUP
    |--|--CONNECT
    |--|--|--APPCONNECT
    |--|--|--|--PRETRANSFER
    |--|--|--|--|--STARTTRANSFER
    |--|--|--|--|--|--TOTAL
    |--|--|--|--|--|--REDIRECT
.fi
.IP NAMELOOKUP
\fICURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the name
resolving was completed.
.IP CONNECT
\fICURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the connect
to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
.IP APPCONNECT
\fICURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the SSL
connect/handshake with the remote host was completed. (Added in in 7.19.0)
.IP PRETRANSFER
\fICURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the
file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands
and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
.IP STARTTRANSFER
\fICURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the
first byte is received by libcurl.
.IP TOTAL
\fICURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME\fP. Total time of the previous request.
.IP REDIRECT
\fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME\fP. The time it took for all redirection steps
include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before final
transaction was started. So, this is zero if no redirection took place.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the operation was successful, CURLE_OK is returned. Otherwise an
appropriate error code will be returned.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR curl_easy_setopt "(3)"
